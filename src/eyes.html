      Observation of Eyes is a series of animations and motion graphics I
      created during the worst time of the pandemic. Being forced to do all my
      works in front of the screen, my eyes started to have bad symptoms. This
      project shows how our vision is occupied by electronic images.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      The project started with the observation of my eyes from multiple
      perspectives. I recorded my observation through writing journals and
      taking photos. Meanwhile, I collected information about the student's
      habit of using their eyes.

        If I had to stay inside because of the pandemic, then my eyes become the
        only thing that I can perceive the outside world. Screens could fulfill
        my need for visual sense, but they could not simulate the environment.
        People feel environment not only through eyes but also through hearing,
        smelling, and touching.

        It seems like as long as I keep my daily routine, the appearance of my
        eyes wonâ€™t change much. But the daily routine is not that healthy. It
        was because I rely on the screen to do everything. I began to find
        excuses for myself, that I need the screen to do serious things. I made
        this animation that I only spent 5 hours on the screen to edit in 3
        weeks.

        Now I have 3 devices that take turns to give me notifications of random
        things. They are also a reminder for me to keep up with my schedule.
        These ringtones are now the only thing that makes a clear sound in my
        room. Because I was in the small room, my attention and my eyes are
        forced to be guided to the device.
