    <p class="description">
      This project was created to explore how we could use the body to create
      messages. Besides words, people also use body language for communication.
      Our body makes daily communication more complete because it also carries
      our emotions. If we are used to combining speaking and body motion, can we
      also combine writing and body motion? Therefore I came up with this
      project that combines writings and body motion. I used p5.js, ml5 and
      PoseNet to create an interaction program that allows people to type in the
      message they want and draw it out using their body. The project also
      explores how I could use trained models(body motion tracking) and coding
      in my works. It was exciting to see how accessible the coding was to
      designers who don't have much CS experience.
