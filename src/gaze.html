    <p class="description">
      Gaze is a project that recalls family memories. I interviewed my parents
      and my grandparents about their experience as parents of international
      students. My two uncles studied abroad at the end of the 20th century,
      they were the typical international students when China just opened the
      door to the rest of the world. Two decades later, I went to study abroad
      when people in both China and the United States were already familiar with
      international students.

      In recent years, the uncertainties of China and the United States
      relationship was the most concerning topic among international students
      and their families. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic changed people's mind
      about many things in life. Therefore I think it was a perfect opportunity
      to rethink what sending children to study abroad means to a Chinese middle
      class family. The book was made up of two parts: an interview with my
      grandfather and an interview with my parents. The pages of both sections
      were separated into two columns for bilingual content.

        I concluded five questions as an outline of the interview. These are the
        questions that I wanted to ask my family, but never found the right time
        to do so. I asked my grandfather and my parents the same questions, and
        displayed their answers alongside photos for comparison. After the
        interview, I transcribed the conversation and rearranged them so they
        are easy to read. I interviewed my family in Chinese, and I translated
        the content into English.
