    <p class="description">
      Museum of Names is a branding project that designs for a museum that
      dedicates to explore the content of names. The inspiration for brand
      identity comes from the flexibility and joinable nature of names.

    <p class="description">
      Because the targeted audience is the group of people who are aware of
      their cultural background, it would be interesting to use different
      languages in the design. I tried to not limit the names inside the logo
      shape only in English. The content inside the logo could be replaced by
      any names in any language. The logo could also serve as a container for
      images or texts. In the staking state, the position and orientation of
      each letter shapes are flexible. I designed the brochure, posters, and
      banner for the museum to support the identity system. The composition of
      the shapes came from building blocks, and also the flexible nature of
      names.
