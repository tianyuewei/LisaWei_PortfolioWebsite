    <p class="description">
      Resound is a pop-up project that uses sound and projection in underground
      tunnels to recall peopleâ€™s memory of warm weather. The cold winter of
      Minnesota stopped people from walking on the streets, and the Covid-19
      pandemic made it difficult for people to meet up in public spaces. The
      project was inspired by the complex underground tunnel and skyway system
      around Minneapolis and St. Paul downtown and college campus. When I talked
      with students on campus, their impression of the tunnels was both warm and
      cold. Because these facilities were made purely for the purpose of
      convenience, and the spaces were very plain. However, the space is a
      shelter for students to avoid the cold winter of Minnesota. The project is
      responding to students' feeling of secureness towards the underground
      tunnel, and using the plain space for exchanging happy memories.

        The project began with interviewing students at University of Minnesota.
        By personally visiting the site and talking with people, I gradually
        developed the idea of using sound and image to decorate the plain
        hallway space.
